            <p class="content" style="font-weight:600;line-height: 40px;">In communications and information processing, code is a system of rules to convert information—such as a letter, word, sound, image, or gesture—into
                another form, sometimes shortened or secret, for communication through a communication channel or storage in a storage medium. An early example is the
                invention of language, which enabled a person, through speech, to communicate what they thought, saw, heard or felt to others. But speech limits the
                range of communication to the distance a voice can carry, and limits the audience to those present when the speech is uttered . The invention of
                writing, which converted spoken language into visual symbols, extended the range of communication across space and time. The process of encoding
                converts information from a source into symbols for communication or storage. Decoding is the reverse process, converting code symbols back into a
                form that the recipient understands, such as English or/and Spanish. One reason for coding is to enable communication in places where ordinary
                plain language, spoken or written, is difficult or impossible. For example, semaphore, where the configuration of flags held by a signaler or the
                arms of a semaphore tower encodes parts of the message, typically individual letters and numbers. Another person standing a great distance away
                can interpret the flags and reproduce the words sent.
